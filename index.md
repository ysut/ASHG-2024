# Supplementary Information of Poster Presentation in ASHG 2024
# Description
This page contains supplementary information.

## The list of eLoF genes
A Microsft Excel format file is available.
[![Here](http://colab.research.google.com/github/ysut/2024_CellGenomics/blob/develop/main.ipynb)].

## Analysis note as Google colab
The code used for reanalyzing WES can be replicated in Google Colab.
The sample of 2000 randomly selected variants (2 sets) has also been uploaded.
